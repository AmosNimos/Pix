[ Intro ]

I know sometimes things might not always make sense to you right now
But hey, what daddy always tell you’ Straighten up little soldier
Stiffen up that upper lip What’chu crying about?
You got me..

[ Verse 1 ]

Hailie, I know you miss your mom and I know you miss your dad
When I’m gone but I’m trying to give you the life that I never had
I can see you’re sad, even when you smile even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes deep inside, you wanna cry
Cause you’re scared I ain’t there, Daddy’s with you in your prayers
No more cryin wipe them tears, Daddy’s here no more nightmares
We gonna pull together through it we gonna do it
Lainie, uncle’s crazy ain’t he,  but he loves you girl and you better know it
We’re all we got in this world when it spins, when it swirls
When it whirls, when it twirls, two little beautiful girls
Lookin puzzled, in a daze I know it’s confusing you
Daddy’s always on the move, Mama’s always on the news
I try to keep you sheltered from it but somehow it seems
The harder that I try to do that the more it backfires on me
All the things, growin up as daddy that he had to see
Daddy don’t want you to see but you see just as much as he did
We did not plan it to be this way your mother and me
But things have got so bad between us I don’t see us ever being together ever again
Like we used to be like when was teenagers but then of course everything always happen for a reason
I guess it was never meant to be but it’s just something we have no control over
And that’s what destiny is, but no more worries rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day we’ll wake up and this will all just be a dream

[ Chorus ]

Now hush little baby don’t you cry everythings gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up little lady I told ya
Daddy’s here to hold ya through the night
I know mommy’s not here right now and we don’t know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise Mama’s gon be alright

[ Verse 2 ]

It’s funny, I remember back one year when daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the Christamas presents up and stuck em under the tree
and said some of em were from me cause daddy couldn’t buy em
I’ll never forget that Christmas I sat up the whole night cryin
Cause daddy felt like a bum, see Daddy had a job
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom
And at the time every house that we lived in
Either kept getting broken into and robbed or shot up on the block
And your mom, was saving money for you in a jar trying to start a piggy bank for you
So you could go to college, almost had a thousand dollars
Till someone broke in and stole it and I know it hurt so bad it broke your mamma’s heart
And it seemed like everything was just starting to fall apart
Mom and dad was arguing a lot so mama moved back on the chalmers in a flat
One bedroom apartment and dad moved back to the other side of 8 mile on Novara
And that’s when Daddy went to California with his CD
And met Dr. Dre and flew you
